Let me clarify the details of the Buyback Enhancement Campaign for you. 👉

🔹 What does the campaign offer?
The campaign is a special promotion that enhances the buyback value of your gold, diamond, or luxury items. By participating in the campaign, you can get increased cashback for your item.

🔹 How does it work?
During the campaign period, our appraisal team will assess your item's value at a higher rate than usual. This means you'll receive a higher cashback amount compared to our regular appraisal standards.

🔹 What items are eligible?
The campaign is open to a wide range of items, including:

* Gold jewelry (e.g., necklaces, earrings, rings)
* Diamond accessories (e.g., engagement rings, pendants)
* Luxury watches
* High-end fashion items (e.g., designer handbags, wallets)

🔹 How do I participate?
To take advantage of the campaign, simply bring your item to our store during the campaign period. Our appraisal team will assess the value of your item and provide a cashback offer.

📝 Campaign Period:
The campaign will run from [start date] to [end date]. Don't miss this opportunity to get a higher cashback for your item! 🕰️

**Important Notes:**

* The campaign is only valid for a limited time, so be sure to check the start and end dates.
* The campaign is only applicable to items that meet our appraisal standards.
* The campaign does not affect our regular appraisal process, and appraisals will still be conducted based on item condition, rarity, and market demand.
